🔧 JLCMC Split Aluminum Enclosure for Custom Electronics DIY Projects
Whether you're building an Arduino-based sensor, a small robotics system, or any other custom electronics, this enclosure is a great option for turning your tech idea into a stylish, functional, and protected device.
Not only will I walk you through the steps of customizing this enclosure to fit your project, but I’ll also show how to integrate heat sinks, brackets, and other components — all available on JLCMC — to take your project to the next level. 🚀

🧱 Why the JLCMC Split Aluminum Enclosure?
The JLCMC Split Aluminum Enclosure isn’t just another generic case — it’s a purpose-built, high-quality housing for makers, tinkerers, and engineers. 🧑‍🔬
Here’s why it’s ideal for DIY projects:

📏 Dimensions: 106mm x 40mm x 110mm — fits a wide range of projects

🧲 High-Quality Aluminum: Durable, corrosion-resistant, and lightweight

🔩 Pre-Drilled Mounting Holes: Easy assembly and modification

🔌 Versatile Use: Great for Arduino, ESP32, sensors, or embedded systems

🧰 What You’ll Need
🧾 Materials
📦 Split Aluminum Enclosure (W106 H40 L110mm)

🧠 Arduino Board (using Arduino Uno for this build)

⚡ Power Supply (DC adapter or battery pack)

🌬️ Heat Sinks – BR10260 Fan Parts | JLCMC

🔧 Brackets – L-Shaped Bracket | JLCMC

🔩 Mounting Screws – (Recommended: M3 x 6mm or 8mm)

📐 Standoffs – M3 x 10/12mm, Nylon or Metal | JLCMC

🔌 Connectors and Wires

🛠️ Tools
🪛 Screwdriver

🪚 Dremel or Metal File

🛠️ Drill

📏 Ruler/Measuring Tape

✏️ Pencil or Marker

🧠 Step 1: Planning and Design
Before cutting or mounting, plan your system layout carefully.

📍 Arduino Layout

🧲 Mounted near the base for stability

🔌 USB/power ports aligned with enclosure edge

🔩 Mounted with screws or brackets

🧭 Component Placement

⚡ Motor driver and power supply next to Arduino

🎛️ Manual motion platform mounted externally for easy access

🧹 Cable Management: Use ties or clips to avoid clutter

📡 Sensors and Modules

🚨 Motion Sensor: Mounted on one side for clear detection

🌀 Servo Motor: Mounted opposite side for balance and wiring clearance

⚙️ Servo Control Tip: Use Servo.h in Arduino IDE for control

🔌 Ports and Ventilation

USB and power ports should remain accessible

🌀 Drill holes or slots for airflow and cooling

🔧 Step 2: Preparing the Enclosure
🪚 Cut Out Ports: Use a Dremel or file for USB, power, etc.

🔩 Ventilation: Drill holes if components produce heat

📏 Mark and Drill: Use ruler and pencil for precision

🔩 Step 3: Mounting the Electronics
🧲 Mount Arduino: Use standoffs/screws, leave USB accessible

🧱 Install Components: Brackets for sensors, motors, etc.

🌡️ Add Heat Sinks: Cool down any heat-sensitive parts

🔌 Step 4: Wiring and Powering Your Project
⚡ Connect Power: DC adapter or battery to Arduino

🔗 Wire Sensors/Modules: Route cleanly to digital pins

✅ Test Before Sealing: Ensure everything works as expected

📦 Step 5: Final Assembly
🔒 Close the Enclosure: Secure top with screws (don’t overtighten)

🧪 Final System Test: Power up, test functionality

🧹 Final Cable Check: Tidy up cables and ensure airflow
