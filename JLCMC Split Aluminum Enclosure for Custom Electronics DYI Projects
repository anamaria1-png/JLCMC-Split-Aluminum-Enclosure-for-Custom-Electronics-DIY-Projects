What You’ll Need
Materials
Split Aluminum Enclosure (W106 H40 L110mm)

Arduino (Uno or compatible)

Power Supply (DC adapter or battery)

🌬️ Heat Sinks – e.g., BR10260 Fan Parts

🔧 Brackets – e.g., Aluminum L-Bracket

🔩 Mounting Screws – M3 x 6mm or 8mm

📐 Standoffs – M3 x 10–12mm (nylon or metal)

Connectors and wires

Tools
Screwdriver

Dremel or metal file

Drill

Ruler / Measuring tape

Pencil / Marker

🧠 Step 1: Planning and Design
Arduino Placement

Positioned near the bottom for stability

USB and power ports aligned with enclosure edge

Secured with screws or adhesive

Motor Driver / Power Supply

Next to Arduino, avoiding port obstruction

External Manual Motion Platform

Mounted outside the case, aligned with edge

Sensors / Modules

🚨 Motion Sensor on one side for clear detection

🌀 Servo Motor on the opposite side for balance

Ports & Ventilation

🧊 Add airflow holes if heat is generated

Ensure USB/power ports remain accessible

Cable Management

Use zip ties or clips

Keep power and signal lines separate

🔧 Step 2: Preparing the Enclosure
Cut port holes using Dremel or file

Drill ventilation holes as needed

Mark all drill points carefully

🔩 Step 3: Mounting Electronics
Mount Arduino using standoffs and screws

Install sensors and other modules securely

🌡️ Add heat sinks to heat-prone components

🔌 Step 4: Wiring & Power
Connect DC adapter or battery to Arduino

Attach sensors/modules to appropriate pins

✅ Test before closing the case

📦 Step 5: Final Assembly
Close enclosure with screws

Final test: ensure system works

Tidy cables, confirm ventilation is clear
